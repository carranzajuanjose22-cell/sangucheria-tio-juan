Adapt: keep the cursor-as-actor and static-stage state-tour signature; use two confirmed Vitaly states and a matched container morph instead of a camera chase.
Scene 1 (0.0–0.8s): continue the app-frame unchanged; a custom amber cursor enters and lands on one patient row with a restrained ripple as the title “Historia clinica” reveals above — locked camera, layered-depth surface.
Scene 2 (0.8–1.9s): the selected row expands into a clinical-history timeline through an anchored panel expansion; session nodes draw downward (`svg-path-draw`) exactly as “Historias clinicas” is spoken — asymmetric 60/40, medium density, two clear focal points.
Scene 3 (1.9–2.7s): on “cobros”, the same rounded container morphs in place (`card-morph-anchor`) to a payments state; three payment rows cascade and one status pill changes to “Al dia” through a discrete state swap — no cut, no zoom.
Scene 4 (2.7–3.273417s): “Siempre en orden” lands above the surface while the outer frame contracts into the central-card handoff at x=540, y=960, scale=0.88, opacity=1. Everything holds still after the final word.

## Selected blueprint: cursor-ui-demo

# cursor-ui-demo — Cursor-Driven UI Demo

**intent**: A visible custom cursor drives a real (reconstructed) app UI through clicks / hovers / drags so the screen changes state shot-to-shot, while the camera chases each interaction — the product surface is the subject and the cursor is the actor.

**roles served**

- Product_Intro (from `product-intro-cursor-ui-demo`): first look at the product surface — the cursor sweeps/hovers to \_introduce\* the app and reveal what it is, landing on a hovered hero element or freshly-popped result. Light, exploratory; backdrop steps colors as it goes.
- Key_Feature (from `key-feature-cursor-ui-demo`): one specific multi-step workflow demonstrated \_end-to-end\* (edit / configure / select across 2–4 discrete beats), each beat a real edit the UI responds to live, landing locked on the primary action button or the produced result.
- Key_Feature (from `workflow-approve-press`): an agency / confirmation workflow framed by a cockpit of 3D-tilted flanks — a step list ticks pending → active → complete (a snap state machine, CSS responding to `[data-state]`), and a flank button takes the PRESS as the payoff (its color flips to success, a checkmark stamps). The click is the climax, not a passing gesture.
- Key_Feature (from `cursor-app-state-tour`): the static-stage STATE TOUR — the cursor drives a reconstructed app through 2–4 discrete feature states on a LOCKED frame; every scene change is a click-triggered element swap/scale (modal springs from center, side panel slides in from the right edge, settings hard-swap, table populates, node-graph builds), never a real camera move; optional `[title card]` Scene 0 in front and a `[brand end beat]` behind.
- Key_Feature (from `drag-field-onto-document`): the DRAG-DROP journey — one continuous zoom-breathing shot of a document workspace: the cursor drags a ghosted `[field chip]` from an inputs sidebar onto the page, drop-snaps it into a placed field, a modal/typing beat completes it, and the placed element is adjusted in close-up before the cursor heads to the `[Finish/CTA]`.
- Product_Intro: the low-event BROWSE — the cursor roams ONE clean page state and the filter controls answer with slight hover updates; no typed input, no title beats, and the shot may end mid-roam.
- Product_Intro (from `hover-inspect-run`): the HOVER-INSPECT run — a click SPAWNS a labeled `[toolbar]`, the camera zooms out from a tight crop to the full page, then the cursor sweeps `[page elements]` while a floating `[inspector panel]` TRACKS the cursor, outline-highlighting and content-snapping per hovered element. (The slice's three-beat dark title prelude, scenes 1–3, belongs to `titlecard-reveal`, not here.)
- Hook: the ambient MULTI-CURSOR canvas — several labeled `[teammate cursors]` work a design canvas simultaneously (grab-drag-drop of components between mockups, recolor/identity swaps on drop) while the canvas group translate-PANS within a static frame and a `[headline]` builds word-group by word-group over the demo; the live workshop itself is the hook. One continuous beat, no cuts, no camera.
- Benefits (from `ui-demo-text-interlude-ui-demo`): the demo|text|demo SANDWICH — two static-stage demo beats of this blueprint bridge through a full-screen kinetic/title interlude and back (cursor acts, UI answers, all "zoom" element scale); the interlude beat is `kinetic-type-beats` material, and the sandwich itself is sequencing above the single-shot unit.

**duration**: 4.0–12.9s (Key_Feature 4.0–12.9s — the mined state tours run long, 10.4–12.9s, and the drag-drop journeys 9.8–10.6s, against the original 4.0–7.3s set; Product_Intro 4.5–9.3s — the low-event browse sets the 4.5s floor; Hook ~6.5s; the Benefits demo|text|demo sandwich totals 11.6–12.8s with each demo half ~4–5s)

**shot structure** (a `[product UI surface]` — fixed app window, dashboard/editor, parallax `[content card]` stack, or a `[container object/icon]` — centered over `[bg color/gradient]`, shown `[flat]` or `[3D-isometric]`; a custom `[brand-colored cursor with icon]` is the protagonist and the camera servos to whatever it touches; UI responds _live_ and in sync with each cursor action. Two role-tuned tempos fold in — Product_Intro **sweeps to introduce**, Key_Feature **performs a workflow** — and the camera spans a spectrum: the full CHASE, one continuous zoom-breathe, or a fully LOCKED static stage where the UI itself does all the moving.)

- **Scene 1 (0.0–~Xs) — surface establishes + first touch.** The `[product UI surface]` arrives centered over `[bg color/gradient]` — either it is simply present (fixed window / dashboard / editor), a 3D-parallax stack of `[content cards]`, or a `[container object/icon]` that FLIES IN with a 3D tumble and settles. The custom `[cursor]` enters. The cursor performs the FIRST action on `[cursor target 1]` and the UI responds live in the same beat. Camera holds or begins a slow push-in toward the acted-on region.
  - _Variant — Product_Intro_: low-commitment first touch — cursor HOVERS/sweeps a control or SWEEP-HIGHLIGHTS a field to `[accent color]`, OR the `[container]` fans open. An optional label/title fades/morphs onto the surface. The point is to _show the surface exists_ and is touchable.
  - _Variant — Key_Feature_: a concrete edit — cursor DRAGS a scrollbar / TYPES into a field / DRAGS a handle, and the UI responds materially (`[scroll]` / value climbs / region resizes). If the surface opened in `[3D-isometric]`, it may snap perspective-FLAT here to read the workflow.
  - _Variant — Key_Feature (static-stage tour)_: an optional Scene 0 — `[title card / kinetic brand word]` on a flat field — hard-cuts or window-SCALES-UP into the surface; the `[app UI]` is fully present from the first frame and the cursor enters and glides to the first control. The camera is LOCKED from the start and stays locked.
  - _Variant — Hook (ambient multi-cursor)_: no single protagonist — several labeled `[teammate cursors]` are already at work across `[N mockups]` on a design canvas; the canvas group translate-PANS within the static frame while a `[headline]` builds word-group by word-group over the top. One continuous beat, no cuts.

- **Scene 2 (~Xs–~Ys) — camera chases to the next interaction (the engine).** The camera MOVES to the next target — push-in + pan / whip-pan / pan-down to `[cursor target k]` — and the cursor performs action k as the UI updates live. Each beat is a discrete interaction connected by a fast camera move; the surface's inner content SWAPS per interaction.
  - _Variant — Product_Intro_: navigation is exploratory — a slow camera pan + depth-of-field FOCUS-PULL across a parallax `[content card]` stack, or the `[container]` fanning into `[N option/content cards]` that SPRING to position. As content swaps, the supporting backdrop STEPS its color (`[bg step 1]` → step 2 → …). Typically one or two such moves.
  - _Variant — Key_Feature_: repeat for `[2–4 beats total]`, each a distinct operation the UI answers — counter COUNTS UP, `[pill/swatch]` SELECTS, a modal SLIDES UP and TYPES — connected by whip-pans / progressive zoom. The workflow visibly advances toward a result.
  - _Variant — Key_Feature (static-stage tour)_: the camera never moves — every beat is a click-triggered ELEMENT response: a modal SPRINGS/scales up from center, a `[side detail panel]` SLIDES in from the right edge (a second panel may slide over the first), hamburger→sidebar slide-open, a settings panel HARD-swaps its content, a dropdown fills, a `[table]` populates row-by-row, a formula types into a cell and the range populates on enter, a type-to-filter list live-collapses, a `[block]` pops into the canvas, a node-graph BUILDS (cards + connecting lines radiate from center), a hover drops a `[popover]` below a tag. Any "zoom" is element scale of the UI only.
  - _Variant — Key_Feature (drag-drop)_: the cursor GRABS a `[field chip]` from an `[inputs sidebar]`, drags a semi-transparent GHOST across the page, and drops it — it SNAPS into a placed field with bounding box + corner handles; a completion beat follows (a `[modal]` springs up over the dimmed document, a name types letter-by-letter while a live `[cursive preview]` builds per keystroke, confirm click). The whole clip rides one continuous zoom-BREATHING arc (slow zoom-out / gentle zoom-in / final zoom-out) instead of discrete camera beats.
  - _Variant — Product_Intro (hover-inspect)_: the cursor's first click SPAWNS a labeled `[toolbar]`, the camera zooms OUT from a tight crop to the full page, then the cursor sweeps `[page elements]` — each hovered element gets an outline and a floating `[inspector panel]` TRACKS the cursor, its content snapping per element.

- **Scene 3 (~Ys–end) — payoff state, camera settles, HOLD.** The cursor lands on its final target and the screen reaches the payoff state; the camera comes to rest (static) and holds.
  - _Variant — Product_Intro_: the cursor HOVERS the hero element — a `[content card]` SCALES UP on hover, a node gets an `[Available]`-style pill, or a `[result card]` POPS/springs in — the "here's the product" payoff. Settles static, holds.
  - _Variant — Key_Feature_: locked close-up on the OUTCOME — cursor lands on the `[primary action button: Export / Save / Reimburse]` and a `[hover backdrop / highlight]` SPRING-pops in (the climax is the action button / produced result). Holds.
  - _Variant — Key_Feature (static-stage tour)_: optional detachable end beat — `[brand text beat / icon-ring lockup / end stat card]` — or the cursor simply comes to REST on the next target and holds (006_claudeai ends with the cursor on a panel's close X, the panel never closing).
  - _Variant — Key_Feature (drag-drop)_: close-up on the placed element ADJUSTED — a corner-handle drag proportionally resizes it — then the cursor sweeps toward the `[Finish / CTA]` as the clip ends.
  - _Variant — browse / hover-inspect_: no payoff lock at all — the shot ends MID-demo, cursor still roaming (browse and hover-inspect modes).

**rule mapping**

- viewport follows the cursor / camera servos to whatever it touches (primary) → `camera-cursor-tracking`
- cursor moves to a target, presses, emits a ripple (the click itself — primary interaction primitive) → `cursor-click-ripple`
- screen-state swap shot-to-shot (surface inner content changes between beats) → `scale-swap-transition`
- camera push-in + pan / whip-pan / pan-down to the next target → `viewport-change` (pan/zoom across the UI)
- sequencing the chase into discrete interaction beats → `multi-phase-camera`
- zoom onto the specific acted-on UI region → `coordinate-target-zoom`
- cursor icon/state changing with context (e.g. pointer↔grab over a draggable handle) → `context-sensitive-cursor`
- which content appears per beat / step-by-step UI state progression / per-interaction swaps → `dynamic-content-sequencing`
- sweep-highlight a field, highlight a UI keyword to `[accent color]` → `asr-keyword-glow` (keyword glow on the touched element)
- clicked button compresses on press, springs back on release → `press-release-spring`
- cursor + button compress together on a heavier press → `physics-press-reaction`
- panel/card morphs between two states (e.g. card → expanded card, surface state A → B) → `card-morph-anchor`
- terminal hover-scale, `[result card]` pop-in, spring hover-backdrop on the final action button → `spring-pop-entrance`
- card fan-out to corners / option cards springing to position → `split-tilt-cards` (fan/spread into tilted positions) + `spring-pop-entrance` (the spring settle)
- 3D-parallax content-card stack as the surface; UI shown 3D-isometric → `3d-page-scroll` (UI as a tilted scrolling/parallax card)
- node gets an `[Available]`-style pill / tracked badge appears on an element → `ai-tracking-box`
- counter / value count-up as the UI responds → `counting-dynamic-scale`
- a result bar / number FILLS as the workflow's outcome → `stat-bars-and-fills`
- a live `[video]` screen-capture clip used as the surface → technique: video compositing
- perspective-flatten (3D-isometric → flat 2D snap) and the 3D-isometric tilt itself → technique: CSS-3D (no dedicated rule; the tilt/flatten transform is a CSS-3D primitive)
- camera settles static on the payoff and HOLDS → (settle phase of `spring-pop-entrance` on the payoff element; the static hold itself needs no rule)
- 3D container/object fly-in & tumble-settle → `depth-scatter-assemble` (free-tumbling 3D object/container entrance that flies in and tumble-settles; `orbit-3d-entry` only orbits a flat element into place)
- depth-of-field focus-pull across the parallax card stack → `depth-of-field-blur` (rack-focus / DoF blur transition between near and far cards; `3d-page-scroll` supplies the tilted parallax stack and `viewport-change` the pan)
- paginated/stepped backdrop color advance synced to interactions (`[bg step 1]`→step 2→…) → `discrete-text-sequence` (discrete state stepping, here applied to a background-color state rather than text)
- modal slide-up + in-modal typing as one combined beat → `card-morph-anchor` / `scale-swap-transition` (the panel slide-in) + `discrete-text-sequence` (the in-modal typed text)
- element-scale fake zoom — the UI window scales, camera locked (static-stage tour) → `coordinate-target-zoom` (applied to the surface wrapper rather than the world)
- side detail panel slide-in from the right edge / hamburger→sidebar slide-open / hover popover drop → `card-morph-anchor` / `scale-swap-transition` (the panel arrival) + `dynamic-content-sequencing` (which content each panel shows per beat)
- hard panel swap / in-panel content snapping through states / hover-triggered micro update / type-to-filter live-collapse / element identity swap on drop → `dynamic-content-sequencing`
- table populates row-by-row / fill-handle auto-fill cascading down rows / log rows cascade in → `waterfall-entry`
- formula typed into a cell / character-by-character auto-typing with blinking caret / letter-by-letter typed name → `discrete-text-sequence` + `context-sensitive-cursor` (the caret)
- node-graph build (cards + connecting lines radiate from center) → `center-outward-expansion` (the cards) + `svg-path-draw` (the connecting lines draw)
- click spawns a labeled toolbar / dropdown fills on click / drop-snap settle of the placed field / window scale-up with settle → `spring-pop-entrance`
- modal spring-up over a dimming document → `spring-pop-entrance` (the modal) + `depth-of-field-blur` (the document dim/blur beneath)
- ghost-chip drag-and-drop / cursor grab-drag of components between mockups / fill-handle drag / corner-handle resize drag → `cursor-drag` (`cursor-click-ripple` covers move+click only)
- floating inspector panel TRACKS the cursor, content snapping per element → `ai-tracking-box` (the per-frame follow mechanics, restyled as an inspector panel) + `dynamic-content-sequencing` (the per-element content)
- live cursive preview building per typed keystroke → `svg-path-draw` (progressive stroke reveal keyed to typing progress)
- continuous zoom-breathing single shot (drag-drop variant) → `multi-phase-camera` (pull-back / focus / push phases + micro-drift)
- motion-blur window fly-in / tight-crop open then zoom-out to full page → `motion-blur-streak` (the fly-in) + `viewport-change` (the zoom-out)
- multiple labeled collaborative cursors moving independently → `multi-cursor-choreography` (N labeled independent cursor actors; the single-actor cursor rules assume one)
- canvas-group translate-pan within a static frame → `viewport-change` (the `.world` translate realizes the pan; semantically the camera stays locked)
- headline builds word-group by word-group over the demo → `waterfall-entry`
- brand icon-ring end beat → `svg-path-draw` (the ring) + `spring-pop-entrance` (the lockup)
- 3D end-card float on the hold → `sine-wave-loop` — CAUTION: motion-doctrine bans idle wobble; prefer a settle-and-hold

**camera modifier**: The defining motion is the camera CHASE — the viewport follows the cursor from target to target via `camera-cursor-tracking` (primary), realized as concrete push-in + pan / whip-pan / pan-down moves under `viewport-change`, sequenced into discrete interaction beats by `multi-phase-camera`, with each beat's destination targeted via `coordinate-target-zoom` (zoom to the acted-on region). Product_Intro biases toward a slow, exploratory pan + focus-pull that sweeps the surface; Key_Feature biases toward snappier whip-pans / progressive zoom that march through the workflow and lock static on the action button. This camera-servo-to-cursor is what separates the blueprint from hands-off camera scrolls (dataviz-scroll-reveal) and static device/window tours. The golden set widens this into a spectrum. At one pole the **static-stage state tour** (now the largest member set) LOCKS the camera for the entire clip and lets the UI itself do all the moving — panel slide-ins, element-scale fake zooms, content snaps — with the cursor alone carrying the eye. The **drag-drop** variant replaces discrete chase beats with ONE continuous zoom-breathing arc under `multi-phase-camera`. The **hover-inspect** variant inverts the push-in: a tight-crop open zooms OUT to the full page before the cursor sweep. Pick the pole per brief — chase for workflow marches, locked stage for dense reconstructed dashboards, a single breathe for one-document journeys. With the locked pole absorbed, what separates this blueprint from `device-surface-showcase` is the CURSOR-as-actor, not the camera: a fully static tour still belongs here as long as a visible cursor drives every state change.

# Card Morph Anchor

A free-floating container morphs apparent size, corner radius, and surface treatment between two shots — the morph itself IS the transition; the viewer's eye tracks the persistent container. Distinct from [anchored-layout-expand.md](anchored-layout-expand.md) (an edge-pinned live layout participant that grows along one axis and reflows neighbors — here nothing is pushed) and [theme-crossfade-morph.md](theme-crossfade-morph.md) (a whole-theme reskin under a fixed anchor — here a single container changes shape).

## How It Works

Since `width`/`height` tweens are forbidden, **substitute uniform `scale` for apparent size**; the remaining morph channels are **paint-only**: `borderRadius`, `background`, `boxShadow`. All channels ride ONE tween (one ease, one duration) so the shape morphs in lockstep. Content choreography: old content fades out during the first ~40% of the morph, new content fades in during the last ~40% — the shape-only gap between is the natural "blink." Optionally the morph card itself fades at the very end, revealing the real next-shot element rendered behind it.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<!-- DOM order = stacking: the anchor renders BEFORE the card, so the card is on top -->
<div class="next-shot-anchor"><img src="{nextShotAnchor}" alt="anchor" /></div>
<div class="morph-card">
  <div class="content-old">{shotOneContent}</div>
  <div class="content-new">{shotTwoContent}</div>
</div>
```

```css
.morph-card {
  width: SHOT_ONE_W;
  height: SHOT_ONE_H; /* shot-1 geometry; the morph is scale, never width/height */
  border-radius: SHOT_ONE_RADIUS;
  background: {surfaceShotOne};
  overflow: hidden; /* content must clip during the shape change */
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
  will-change: transform;
}
.content-old,
.content-new {
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0;
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
}
.content-new {
  opacity: 0; /* author its inner sizes at apparent-size ÷ END_SCALE — it scales with the card */
}
.next-shot-anchor {
  position: absolute;
  opacity: 0; /* fades in as the morph card fades out */
}
```

```js
const END_SCALE = SHOT_TWO_W / SHOT_ONE_W; // uniform — keep the two shots aspect-matched

// Hold shot 1 for HOLD_BEAT first — an instant morph reads as glitchy.

// One tween, all channels: uniform scale + paint-only properties.
tl.to(
  ".morph-card",
  {
    scale: END_SCALE,
    borderRadius: SHOT_TWO_RADIUS / END_SCALE, // borderRadius is pre-scale — divide to land the APPARENT radius
    background: "{surfaceShotTwo}",
    boxShadow: "{shadowShotTwo}",
    duration: MORPH_DUR,
    ease: "power2.inOut",
  },
  MORPH_START,
);

tl.to(
  ".content-old",
  { opacity: 0, duration: MORPH_DUR * OLD_FADE_FRAC, ease: "power1.in" },
  MORPH_START,
);
tl.to(
  ".content-new",
  { opacity: 1, duration: MORPH_DUR * NEW_FADE_FRAC, ease: "power1.out" },
  MORPH_START + MORPH_DUR * (1 - NEW_FADE_FRAC),
);

// Optional handoff — card fades out over the pixel-identical real anchor.
tl.to(
  ".morph-card",
  { opacity: 0, duration: MORPH_DUR * FINAL_FADE_FRAC, ease: "power1.in", immediateRender: false },
  MORPH_START + MORPH_DUR * (1 - FINAL_FADE_FRAC),
);
tl.to(
  ".next-shot-anchor",
  { opacity: 1, duration: MORPH_DUR * FINAL_FADE_FRAC, ease: "power1.out" },
  MORPH_START + MORPH_DUR * (1 - FINAL_FADE_FRAC),
);
```

## Morph channels

| channel        | how                                                                                            |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| apparent size  | uniform `scale` — the substitution for the forbidden `width`/`height` tween; aspect preserved  |
| `borderRadius` | paint-only; pre-scale units — tween to `APPARENT_RADIUS / END_SCALE`, ≤ half the smaller side  |
| `background`   | paint-only; gradients interpolate only with equal stop counts (solid→solid: `backgroundColor`) |
| `boxShadow`    | paint-only; base shadow → accent glow shifts emphasis                                          |

## Variations

- **Landing on a non-centered target** (dock icon, sidebar slot): add `x`/`y` to the same tween, computed as the FLIP-style delta between the card's and the target's rects — `getBoundingClientRect()` both at build time (single-scene only, per the contract) and tween the difference. Don't hand-compute from CSS values: paddings, borders, and parent transforms compound, and center-vs-edge arithmetic is the classic off-by-half bug.
- **Aspect change between shots**: uniform scale preserves aspect — morph to the nearest uniform fit and let the crossfade/handoff absorb the small delta, or drop the handoff and hold the card's final state.

## Values

| token             | range                     | notes                                                                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| HOLD_BEAT         | 0.6–1.5s                  | ≥ shot 1's entry settle; the viewer must register shot 1 first                       |
| MORPH_DUR         | 0.6–1.2s                  | < 0.5s can't fit both content fades                                                  |
| END_SCALE         | SHOT_TWO_W / SHOT_ONE_W   | icon-sized handoffs typically land at 80–400px apparent width                        |
| SHOT_TWO_RADIUS   | ≤ min(W, H)/2 apparent    | half the smaller side = perfect circle; beyond is clamped                            |
| OLD/NEW_FADE_FRAC | 0.3–0.5 each, sum ≤ 1     | the gap between is the shape-only "blink"                                            |
| FINAL_FADE_FRAC   | 0 (no handoff) or 0.1–0.2 | only when a pixel-identical anchor exists                                            |
| ease              | `power2.inOut` canonical  | `power3`/`expo.inOut` OK; never `back`/`elastic` — overshoot fights the shape change |

## Critical Constraints

- **❗ Uniform-scale substitution** — never tween `width`/`height`; `scale` + the paint-only channels (`borderRadius`, `background`, `boxShadow`) are the ONLY morph properties.
- **❗ Handoff anchor must be pixel-identical to the card's final state** — same apparent size, radius, background, shadow, inner icon dimensions. Any delta = a visible pop during the crossfade. Can't match exactly? Drop the handoff and hold the morph card.
- **❗ Stacking by DOM order, never a z-index snap mid-fade** — render the anchor before the card; a `tl.set({ zIndex })` during an active opacity tween flips stacking before the fade finishes and flickers.
- **`overflow: hidden`** on the card — content must clip as the radius changes.
- **Hold a beat before morphing**; same ease family for shape and crossfade (mixed eases read unsynchronized).

# SVG Path Draw

Reveals an SVG shape by animating its stroke as if a pen were tracing it. Two stroke properties together: **`stroke-dasharray = <pathLength>`** makes the entire path one dash; **`stroke-dashoffset`** starts at the path length (dash shifted fully out of view → invisible) and tweens to `0` (fully drawn). The length comes from the DOM API `path.getTotalLength()` — measured, never guessed.

Works on anything with a stroke: `<path>`, `<circle>`, `<rect>`, `<line>`, `<polyline>`, `<polygon>`, `<ellipse>`.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip -->
<svg class="logo-mark" viewBox="0 0 200 200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <path id="bar-left" d="M 60 40 L 60 160" />
  <path id="bar-right" d="M 140 40 L 140 160" />
  <path id="bar-mid" d="M 60 100 L 140 100" />
</svg>
```

```css
.logo-mark path {
  fill: none; /* outline-only draw — a fill would appear immediately and ruin the reveal */
  stroke: {accentColor};
  stroke-width: 12;
  stroke-linecap: round; /* softer endpoints */
  stroke-linejoin: round;
}
```

```js
// Setup: measure each path and set its dash pattern. Real measured geometry, not a magic number.
document.querySelectorAll(".logo-mark path").forEach((p) => {
  const len = p.getTotalLength();
  p.style.strokeDasharray = `${len}`;
  p.style.strokeDashoffset = `${len}`;
});

// Stagger draws so the eye reads continuous motion — each segment starts at
// ~70-80% of the previous segment's duration, before it finishes.
tl.to(
  "#bar-left",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_1_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#bar-right",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_2_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#bar-mid",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: FINAL_SEGMENT_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_3_START,
);

// Companion wordmark fades in only after the last stroke settles.
tl.to(
  ".brand-line",
  { opacity: 1, duration: BRAND_FADE_DUR, ease: "power1.out" },
  BRAND_FADE_START,
);
```

## Variations

- **Ring starting at 12 o'clock** — `<circle>` / `<rect>` strokes start at 3 o'clock by default; rotate the element `-90deg` so a progress ring draws from the top:

```html
<circle
  cx="100"
  cy="100"
  r="60"
  id="ring"
  style="transform-origin: 100px 100px; transform: rotate(-90deg)"
/>
```

- **Linear (constant-speed) draw** — `ease: "none"` for a steady-rate "real pen" trace.
- **Draw then fill** — for filled shapes, tween `fillOpacity: 0 → 1` AFTER the stroke completes (requires `fill-opacity: 0` initially and a real `fill` in CSS):

```js
tl.to(
  "#path",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_1_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#path",
  { fillOpacity: 1, duration: FILL_FADE_DUR, ease: "power1.out" },
  SEG_1_START + SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR,
);
```

## Values

| token             | range                                   | notes                                                                                              |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR  | 0.3–0.8s                                | fast snap vs deliberate pen trace; >~1s feels sluggish for a logo reveal                           |
| FINAL_SEGMENT_DUR | 60–80% of SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR              | proportional to segment length — a short connector at full duration reads slower than its siblings |
| SEG_N_START       | previous start + 70–80% of its duration | reads as continuous motion, not N isolated animations                                              |
| SEG_1_START       | 0–0.4s                                  | a small ~0.2s lead-in lets the viewer settle before motion                                         |
| BRAND_FADE_START  | ≥ last stroke end (+ ~0.2s beat)        | earlier and the wordmark competes with the draw                                                    |
| BRAND_FADE_DUR    | 0.3–0.8s                                | snap (urgent) vs glide (premium)                                                                   |

Ease families are discrete choices: **stroke draws** use `power2.out` (a hand lifting at end of stroke) or `none` for constant speed — never `back.out` / `elastic.out` (pens don't bounce). **Fades** use `power1.out`.

## Critical Constraints

- **`fill: none`** for outline-only draws — otherwise the fill appears immediately.
- **Dasharray/dashoffset = the measured `getTotalLength()`**, set at setup; requires the SVG in the DOM (inline SVG is fine; a loaded `<image>` SVG is not).
- **Complex paths**: if `getTotalLength()` looks wrong, overestimate slightly (`len * 1.05`) — too large is invisible at animation start; too small clips the end.
- **Stagger multi-path draws at ~70–80%** of the previous segment's duration.
- **A drawn line must land on something.** When the path is a connector (rail, beam, underline, callout) rather than a shape, both endpoints must sit on real elements and the draw must do a job — reveal, route, validate, or emphasize. A stroke that only decorates empty space reads as filler; attach it or cut it.
